# First-ML-project

This repository contains a Diabetes Prediction System built using Python and Scikit-Learn.I have used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify whether a person has diabetes based on various medical attributes.It shows output in 0 and 1

## Introduction

This project is designed to predict whether a person has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measures included in the dataset. The model is trained using an SVM with a linear kernel and evaluated on its accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used is available on Kaggle. It includes the following columns:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 or 1, where 1 indicates diabetes)

## Usage

  Ensure you have the dataset (diabetes.csv) in the project directory.
  
  Run the diabetes_prediction.py script to train the model and make predictions.


## Model Training and Evaluation

The model training and evaluation process includes the following steps:

- Data Collection and Analysis: Load the dataset and perform basic analysis.
- Data Standardization: Standardize the feature variables.
- Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Model Training: Train the SVM model on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy on the training and testing data.
